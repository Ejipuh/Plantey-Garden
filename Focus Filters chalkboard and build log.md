# Focus Filters chalkboard and build log 
*I'm working on reverse-engineering existing projects as fast as I can! This is why I love open-source.*

Focus Filters: *Cognitively-complementary, open-source irrigation for (digital) streams of novelty. RSS feeds unified scattered waterfalls of novelty; this will dam up and filter out as we wish.*


**Official Start of Implementation -- 19:58**
*Reverse-engineering.*

20:42. Now that I setup the public log, I'm reading this: [Newsboat - A Command line RSS/Atom Feed Reader For Text Consoles](https://ostechnix.com/newsbeuter-command-line-rssatom-feed-reader-unix-like-systems/) Written for Linux, not Windows, but I'll take some good dev ideas:
- single file of RSS feeds
- tags for feeds
	- *and for posts by keyword, but I might not get to that tonight*
- central place to read? (*or Obsidian export, if I feel ambitious*)
- *I'm adding in skip-friction filters on top of these. (That's what is my main aim here. Once I have a lightweight version of that, I'll take a break.)*
