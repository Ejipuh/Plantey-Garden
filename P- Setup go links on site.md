# P- Setup go links on site
Objective: make a list of live go links that my site uses that regularly updates to my site

Key Results:
- easily edit go links
- make live list of go links you have
- create go link on upload of digital garden

Relevance:
- if I can't do this, then the links in my posts will be limited and cut off from the rest of my digital garden
- lets me cite them off-hand
