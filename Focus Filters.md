# Focus Filters
*One of a pallet of [[Living Items]]. Mentally-complementary, open-source irrigation for (digital) streams of novelty. RSS feeds unified scattered waterfalls of novelty; this will dam up and filter out as we wish.*

Notes to reader: 
- This will be full of [[wikilinks]]. These connect notes in my interlinked notebook, but you'll only be able to click [links that look like this]. Sorry for the mess. Welcome to my first [[Digital Garage]](https://ethanplante.org/go/digital-garage) project.
- It's a mess, and I'll be updating every so often. Stay posted.
- If you want me to clarify stuff, reply [at this link](https://twitter.com/plantey_tools/status/1336483426048860162?s=20).
- I invite you to build this with me. Feel free to build this yourself and send me questions as I build it. I'll check [my initial Twitter post](https://twitter.com/plantey_tools/status/1336483426048860162?s=20) as well as my PMs 5 minutes after I get stuck or tired.
	- This is because other similar projects either lack the shapeable filtering thing I want, or because they're not easy to setup.

# Terms & Tools & Tool-Terms
- Focus filters: the core of this entire system; these are customizable filters to change what you are made to see at any given time; blocks and explores elements as if they were wise sayings
- Focus-friction


# The Chalkboard
## Current Understanding of Core Goals (For Now)
1. I want to make an interface for focus and priorities, where these are built into what it's doing. An object browser thing... Something built on itself...
2. Make an interface that lets you code into the interface

## Implementing...
2: Create an item* to make enacted experiences...
- [ ] Use cmd ...
- [ ] Learn GT, see how much that can help here? Totally simplify and bootstrap Pharo?
- [ ] *Wait, are these the same thing as operators in GT? What distinguishes an item from a tool here? (see the guy's notes on dynabook)*

For 1:
- [ ] Tag for each data type, sub-tags for search filters... 
	- I want the user to be able to type in a basic filter (so they can learn how to program with it)
- [ ] Make a list of things
- [ ] Go through these, one-by-one, with friction.
	- [ ] Make switching costs tangible. "This frustration is how much your brain is frustrated and taxed when you switch tasks."
- [ ] Tag these things
- [ ] Make certain tags come up first

# Maybe Later
- [[Focus friction for digital novelty]]
- [ ] Parse YouTube RSS feeds with Python and get 5 video titles
	- [ ] Learn to search for string
	- [ ] for each `<entry>`, find title and url, then add tags on your own...
	- [ ] Make single file for RSS feeds when needed

# Alternate taglines
- *Cognitively-complementary, open-source irrigation for (digital) streams of novelty. RSS feeds unified scattered waterfalls of novelty; this will dam up and filter out as we wish.*
- *A single interface from which to interact with new things.*
- *I liked Nick Milo's MOCs and home note so much, I'm making an app that's based on it! (Although mine does add a bit of intentional focus-friction...)*
- *I like the Proverbs and the pedagogy of them, so I want to design a system similar to this: consider one simple thing, get enlightened by realizing it's profound, rinse, repeat.*
- *Hi, Mom!*
