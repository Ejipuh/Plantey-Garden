# Focus Filters
*Mentally-complementary, open-source irrigation for (digital) streams of novelty. RSS feeds unified scattered waterfalls of novelty; this will dam up and filter out as we wish.*

Notes to reader: 
- This will be full of [[wikilinks]]. These connect notes in my interlinked notebook, but you'll only be able to click [links that look like this]. Sorry for the mess. Welcome to my current [[Digital Garage]](https://ethanplante.org/go/digital-garage) project.*
- It's a mess, and I'll be updating every so often. Stay posted.
- If you want me to clarify stuff, reply [at this link](https://twitter.com/plantey_tools/status/1336483426048860162?s=20).
- I invite you to build this with me. Feel free to build this yourself and send me questions as I build it. I'll check [my initial Twitter post](https://twitter.com/plantey_tools/status/1336483426048860162?s=20) as well as my PMs at 21:00. (I'm on ET.)
	- This is because other similar projects either lack the shapeable filtering thing I want, or because they're not easy to setup.
