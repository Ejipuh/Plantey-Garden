# Focus Filters
*Mentally-complementary, open-source irrigation for (digital) streams of novelty. RSS feeds unified scattered waterfalls of novelty; this will dam up and filter out as we wish.*

*Note to reader: this will be full of [[wikilinks]]. These connect notes in my interlinked notebook, but you'll only be able to click [links that look like this]. Sorry for the mess. Welcome to my current [[Digital Garage]](https://ethanplante.org/go/digital-garage) project.*
