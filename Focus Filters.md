# Focus Filters
*Mentally-complementary, open-source irrigation for (digital) streams of novelty. RSS feeds unified scattered waterfalls of novelty; this will dam up and filter out as we wish.*

Notes to reader: 
- This will be full of [[wikilinks]]. These connect notes in my interlinked notebook, but you'll only be able to click [links that look like this]. Sorry for the mess. Welcome to my first [[Digital Garage]](https://ethanplante.org/go/digital-garage) project.
- It's a mess, and I'll be updating every so often. Stay posted.
- If you want me to clarify stuff, reply [at this link](https://twitter.com/plantey_tools/status/1336483426048860162?s=20).
- I invite you to build this with me. Feel free to build this yourself and send me questions as I build it. I'll check [my initial Twitter post](https://twitter.com/plantey_tools/status/1336483426048860162?s=20) as well as my PMs 5 minutes after I get stuck or tired.
	- This is because other similar projects either lack the shapeable filtering thing I want, or because they're not easy to setup.

# Terms & Tools & Tool-Terms
- Focus filters: the core of this entire system; these are customizable filters to change what you are made to see at any given time; blocks and explores elements as if they were wise sayings
- Focus-friction


# The Chalkboard
Project closes at 13:00 tomorrow. *Self, be done with core matters a good bit before then.*

The Core Goal (For Now)
- I want to make an interface for focus and priorities, where these are built into what it's doing. An object browser thing... Something built on itself...
	- [ ] Tag for each data type, sub-tags for search filters...
		- If that sounds like Email Filters: the UI, then it should sound about right.
		- I want the user to be able to type in a basic filter (so they can learn how to program with it)

**Official Start of Implementation -- 19:58**
- [ ] Tag titles 
- [ ] Filter by title
- [ ] Friction to skip?
			- [ ] Doodle video where I walk through my goals with this
- [ ] **For the boys:** I'll be over after I get the tags filter working.

Conditions
- [ ] **Before uploading to GitHub**, choose a policy option

- [[Focus Filters stuff in a big messy note for me]]

# Maybe Later
- [ ] Parse YouTube RSS feeds with Python and get 5 video titles
	- [ ] Learn to search for string
	- [ ] for each `<entry>`, find title and url, then add tags on your own...
	- [ ] Make single file for RSS feeds when needed

# Alternate taglines
- *Cognitively-complementary, open-source irrigation for (digital) streams of novelty. RSS feeds unified scattered waterfalls of novelty; this will dam up and filter out as we wish.*
- *A single interface from which to interact with new things.*
- *I liked Nick Milo's MOCs and home note so much, I'm making an app that's based on it! (Although mine does add a bit of intentional focus-friction...)*
- *I like the Proverbs and the pedagogy of them, so I want to design a system similar to this: consider one simple thing, get enlightened by realizing it's profound, rinse, repeat.*
- *Hi, Mom!*
