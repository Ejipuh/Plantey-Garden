# Continual Command Line Crash Course
*Wielding this crazy tool by understanding it and learning how to learn from it.*


So you want to learn how the windows computer works while also tackling its core functions, and then learn how to be equipped yourself to learn the darn thing. I do too, so you've come to the right place. This is the guide that I wanted when I started learning about computers and tech stuff. 

I'm learning this as I go, but I'll give you what I have so far.

# What he has so far
Let's do this quickly and simply, with [[Focused teaching]]

We'll be using command line and VS Code, but don't worry about downloading anything at this point. Super simple. 

# To Start
Press win-r, type cmd, and hit enter. (A pretty short shortcut, eh?) This stands for "command", and pulls up the command line.

Put (meaning type in and hit enter) `>echo hello`. 


(Commands in this guide look like `>this`, where "this" is the stuff you type into command line.)

Unless one of us is missing something, a new line should pop up that says "hello". (If not, PM me on Twitter, and start the message with ">" so I know it's about this.)


# Continuing onward...
Similar to running a good bit of code, I want to put up the clear parts first and develop the unclear parts. I'll be adding clear parts onto this as we go...

What I plan to add next:
- *What the heck is VS Code and how can it make cmd a lot cooler?*
- *How to wield your computer by creating your own shortcuts to do whatever you want. (In other words: What the heck is AutoHotKey and how can it make using a computer a lot cooler?)*

For now, let's both read `>help` when we're curious as to what else this thing can do.
