# Digital Garden
There are a few different definitions of a digital garden around online, but generally they're online places to do thinking. A blog is where people post finished, polished posts; a digital garden is more of a work-in-progress for writing.


# A Garden with a Greenhouse 
A lot of digital gardens have some really cool stuff, once you peruse through them. At the same time, it gets hard to find the cool and clear bits when a lot of it feels like blog posts that are clear and insightful...until you get halfway through and find that it (Or what feels like the first half of an article.) The whole process is out in the open. 

Personally, I prefer to keep all my raw thinking in Obsidian so I can cultivate it before I set it out before the public eye to be interacted with by others. (I've found that ideas can get a bit shy or unhelpful when I don't clarify them before I share them. They've got to grow up a bit first before they can dialogue with others well.)

In other words, my public digital garden is mostly made up of crops that have grown a bit, whereas my personal notes are more of a Greenhouse for ideas.

In my use[^2], this *digital garden* is an online place to hold my ideas in a way.


What my working goal for this... is is to distinguish between 
- asdf
	- but maybe show working titles and backlinks for users to click on to see how many would be interested in this or that a note (could help me structure my priorities)
		- I'd need a "this was..." thing above each, btw

# Where Project Logs Fit Into This
To clarify: the projects I'm working on in public aren't part of my garden. Instead, they're different enough that I prefer to call them my [[Digital Garage]].

If you're curious as to how I plan to make digital gardens more unique, see [[Digital garden progress]](https://ethanplante.org/go/garden-progress)

[^1]: Note: In my note-taking app, I use `[[wikilinks]]` (which are links between notes that have double brackets) to connect ideas together. A lot of capital These won't be clickable on this site for now. (Though I do need to set that up...)
[^2]: Because I think my usage of this idea is different enough from the common use of it, I might name a new term. This is just my current analogy for now. Subject to change, of course. I just want to distinguish from the common use.
