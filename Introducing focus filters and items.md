# Introducing focus filters and items

Welcome to Focus Filters. My goal for these is to make an interface for using computers that not only intuitively teaches us how to focus, think and code, but also that aims to make each user into a craftsman, who is equipped to make their own items.

# What Is It?
Focus Filters is the name of the software. It consists centrally of Elemental Fractal Filters, Friction, and Items. The three of these are each a digital raw material, ones which one must interact with and tame in order to command. The learner-player does this by a series of prompts, each with a corresponding Friction Level. For beginners, this will be low, but as one progresses, one will find more complex Elements to tame and incorporate into one's inventory.
