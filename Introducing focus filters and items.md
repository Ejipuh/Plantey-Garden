# Introducing focus filters and items

Welcome to [[Focus Filters]]. My goal for these is to make an interface for using computers that not only intuitively teaches us how to focus, think and code, but also that aims to make each user into a craftsman, who is equipped to make their own items.

# What Is It?
Focus Filters is the name of the software. It consists centrally of Elemental Fractal Filters, Friction, and Items. The three of these are each a digital raw material, ones which one must interact with and tame in order to command. The learner-player does this by a series of prompts, each with a corresponding Friction Level. For beginners, this will be low, but as one progresses, one will find more complex Elements to tame and incorporate into one's inventory.

Think Kanban boards as the interface, PARA as the framework, Minecraft as the guiding exploration-minded curiosity, and so on.

You feed in a list of data types, variables, and objects, then...

# An Interface for Focus
*In which each object takes center-stage.*

**Objects** are, well, objects. Any data type: string, article, song, sound, etc.

**Fractal Filters** are strings and sorting criteria for what object to look at next. There will be a preview feature where one can flip through something akin to a jukebox and queue up the next object to look at. 

**Friction** is a small hindrance to skipping the current item. Perhaps a word count.

**Items** are groups of APIs and functions that work together to meet a various amount of tasks and goals. They are specific enough to be tools, but flexible and improvisatory enough to be toys. Fractal Filters and Friction are the two items that I will focus my efforts on first, since they are those which will teach the user *code literacy* , *how to think*, and *how to design other Items*.
