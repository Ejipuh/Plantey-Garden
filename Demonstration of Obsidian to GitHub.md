# Demonstration of Obsidian to GitHub

I just showed you my GitHub repo. Note that this file isn't there. The stuff that there matched the stuff on the left under Plantey-Garden


Now, all I have to do is move this file into Plantey-Garden (where my GitHub repo is locally held), and with the press of a couple buttons (Win-ctrl-c, to be exact), something happens......

























Hello! Me again. I hid this bit earlier. I want to show you that this really updates, so I'm writing some stuff out here to show you. *presses keybind*

Hope you enjoyed :)
