# P- Create a digital garden with chosen Obsidian notes
Hello! If you're here, it means you're interested in my project. In essence, I'm trying to make a fairly easy way to sync Obsidian notes to [my website](ethanplante.org). 


This is where I'm publicly logging my goal to craft a digital garden.



---
Objective: Craft a digital garden that syncs to my website from a folder in Obsidian.

Key results
- [ ] Easy way to put a note in a folder
- [ ] Commits new markdown files from Obsidian subfolder to git
- [ ] Auto-sync from git to website
- [ ] Auto-convert wikilinks in Obsidian to good URIs on site
	- [Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) (thanks, @Flancia for putting this on your garden) 
	- [Evergreen note titles are like APIs](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_note_titles_are_like_APIs)
		- actually, meshes the metaphor! I need a name for this system...
- [ ] Each wikilink page has a go link for it


# scratchpad
Intentionally unclear--to you and to me.



outside the scope of focus right now
- maybe use AHK to run this regularly: ([from Flancia](https://flancia.org/mine/roam-likes/))
	` 
	$ cd garden
	$ git commit -a -m "Some message saying what's in this commit."
	$ git push
	`
- Create an automated way to convert wikilinks to go links
	- would still look like wikilinks to indicate internals
	- the latter would be based on the name for it, and could be a /go/ link that redirects to a part of /garden/[note name]
		- handling duplicate content (for ex., stuff I posted on Twitter)
			- could make list of go links for stuff I've posted and have a thing of code that changes the wikilinks to go links
			- or, I could just put uploaded things in a different
- 



- [ ] after you do this, change it into

Unclear Parts of Reading to Learn from
- I'm not a programmer, so it would be really helpful for 1) & 2) to have options to figure out exactly what the different things are.
	- Relating to this point: *If you see anything confusing here, or things that I'm not giving enough context for, I would really appreciate it if you let me know. I want to make this easy to read and understand so that I can share it confidently with others. Shoot me a Tweet at [@plantey_tools](https://twitter.com/plantey_tools)*
